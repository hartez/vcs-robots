# The idea
The purpose of this repo is to provide a place to collaborate on and ultimately publish a protocol for repo owners to opt-in to the attentions of helpful source-control analyzing bots (while opting-out of the attentions of others). The idea is similar to the [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org/) standard on the web. 

My intent is to leave the [proposed standard](https://github.com/hartez/vcs-robots/blob/master/vcs_robots.md) up and see if anyone cares. Please feel free to bring up particular issues or missing features in the [issues interface](https://github.com/hartez/vcs-robots/issues) and create pull requests for the [standard itself](https://github.com/hartez/vcs-robots/blob/master/vcs_robots.md). 

# Other goals

## Bots list
Another goal of this repo is to provide an up-to-date [list of bots](https://github.com/hartez/vcs-robots/wiki/Bots) which are running against the various public code repository sites so that bot writers can advertise their work and repo owners can see what bots are available for opt-in. 

## Implementations
I'd also love to put in [links to implementations](https://github.com/hartez/vcs-robots/wiki/Implementations) of this protocol that people can reuse in their own robots.
