# The idea
The purpose of this repo is to provide a place to collaborate on and ultimately publish a protocol for repo owners to opt-in to the attentions of helpful source-control analyzing bots (while opting-out of the attentions of others). The idea is similar to the robots.txt standard on the web. 

My intent is to leave the proposed standard up and see if anyone cares. Please feel free to bring up particular issues or missing features in the issues interface and create pull requests for the standard itself. 

# Other goals

## Bots list
Another goal of this repo would be to provide an up-to-date list of bots which are running against the various public code repository sites so that bot writers can advertise their work and repo owners can see what bots are available for opt-in. 

## Implementations
I'd also love to put in links to implementations of this protocol that people can reuse in their own robots.
